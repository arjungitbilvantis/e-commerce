# User Service

## Business Logic

### User Registration
- Implemented a secure registration process that validates user information, prevents duplicate accounts, and sends verification emails.
- Users register via phone number, and OTP is sent to their email.
- First-time users register and can subsequently log in with the same mobile number and OTP sent to their email.

### Authentication
- Developed a secure authentication mechanism using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).

### Profile Management
- Allows users to update their profiles, including personal information.

### Profile Details Captured
- First Name
- Last
